# bevy-vxl - A [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) Rendering Plugin for Raytraced Voxel Worlds.

bevy-vxl is an ðŸš§in-progressðŸš§ custom renderer plugin for the bevy game engine. It is based off of and inspired by II-Day-II's [voxel-raytracer](https://github.com/II-Day-II/voxel_raytracer/). It aims to expand on this renderer and make it compatibel with the bevy game engine.

## Goals
* Full adaptation of the [voxel-raytracer](https://github.com/II-Day-II/voxel_raytracer/) implementation into the bevy eco-system
* Procedural Generation
* Octree Optimization
* Interactible Voxel World
* Voxel Physics
